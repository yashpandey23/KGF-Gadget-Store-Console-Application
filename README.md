The "KGF Gadget Store Console Application" is a Java-based project that simulates an interactive gadget store experience. This console application offers users the ability to navigate through various product categories, view available products, their availability, and corresponding prices.

The program starts by displaying a welcome message, prompting users to select from categories such as Mobile Phones, Laptops, Smartwatches, TVs, and Air Conditioners. Upon selecting a category, users are presented with specific product options and asked to make a choice.

For instance, if a user selects the "Mobile Phones" category, they are then prompted to choose from popular brands like iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung, Nokia, or Mi. Subsequently, the program provides information on the availability status and prices of the chosen product within the selected category.

This project efficiently utilizes Java's Scanner class to capture user input and employs conditional statements to process the user's choices, displaying relevant information based on the selected options. Additionally, it implements nested conditional structures to navigate through product categories and their respective subcategories.

The project aims to simulate a basic store interaction, enabling users to explore available gadgets, their availability status (in stock or out of stock), and corresponding prices within different categories.

Note: This is a console-based simulation designed for educational purposes, offering a basic understanding of conditional statements, user input handling, and simple program navigation in Java.
